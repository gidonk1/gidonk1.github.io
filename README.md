## How To Play

## Implementation
Built using JavaScript.
\
\
Maze is represented as a 2D-array of cells. Note that leading dimension in the maze represents the rows 
as this is how the maze is displayed in HTML. Each cell contains four boolean properties - one for each 
neighbouring cell that tells you whether there is a wall between the two cells. 
\
\
Random maze is generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
\
\
Maze is solved using depth-first search.
